# Frontend Mentor Challenge - Manage Landing Page

## Hi There! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](http://frontendmentor.io).

The challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. I implemented this with HTML5, CSS3, SASS (CSS pre-processor), and some JavaScript.
